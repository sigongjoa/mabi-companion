## Description
The application's design is inconsistent across various pages. Some pages have not been updated with the new design, and the sidebar is not consistently applied throughout the application. This occurs even for pages where no specific design revision was provided, indicating a need for a unified design strategy.

## Expected Behavior
All pages should adhere to a consistent design, including the new header, fonts, colors, and a uniformly applied sidebar, regardless of whether a specific design file was provided for that page.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate through different pages of the application (e.g., `/`, `/assistant`, `/characters`, `/crafting`, `/equipment`, `/favorites`, `/gems`, `/guides`, `/inventory`, `/leaderboard`, `/profile/[id]`, `/qa-board`, `/qa-board/[id]`, `/raid-board`, `/schedule`, `/skills`, `/timers`).
2. Observe inconsistencies in the header, font styles, color schemes, and sidebar integration across these pages.

## Environment
- Next.js 15.2.4
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI
